What we were so happy about was that it shipped in the value pack.  That made for a great price for a great cup of coffee.   \n",

I really like chocolate / mocha flavors, and was interested to try the raspberry.  Got the two boxes, checked the dates (sometimes an issue with K-cups I have found), and eagerly popped one into my brewer.  Smell was amazing and I was excited.  But when I tasted it, I was so disappointed.  Not strong on either the chocolate or raspberry fronts, and the coffee flavor was weak as well.  Now I am stuck with 47 cups I don't want.  I wish I could recommend these, but I must dissent against the popular reviews.  I realize everyone's tastebuds are a bit different, but these are not for me!   \n",

I was told that I would need to drink 12 cups of this a day to help promote milk production.  The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because each bag only gives 2 cups worth of tea.  Other tea I drink will last me at least 4 cups worth. Other than that no complaints.   \n",

              "9  Thank you Shepherds Garden for a great product! The scriptures are well chosen, thoughtful. It really makes a perfect gift and accompaniment to quiet time (or any time!) As for flavor, compared to celestial seasoning's (non-organic) country peach passion, Shepherds is has soft peach tones and a more earthy flavor. Unless you're not a peach person or avid tea lover you should love it. It's organic too, which is VERY important for tea, and being a white tea it also contains less fluoride if that's a consideration for you. I got 5 boxes directly from their site for my mom, grandmom, sister, and friends this Christmas (great to pair w/ homemade breads or coffeecake!). If you don't think you'll dig peach they have a chai that's truly superior to any chai I've tasted, cranberry is good & unique, and peppermint just rocks (free samples at their website too...). No, they're not flavored with crazy artificial chemicals, sweeteners, non-organic leaves, and colorants. But I LIKE THAT! And for goodness sake they're Bible verse teas! How cool is that?!   \n",
